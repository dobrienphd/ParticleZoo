/**
 * @namespace ParticleZoo
 * @brief Main namespace for the ParticleZoo phase space file processing library.
 * 
 * ParticleZoo is a comprehensive C++ library for reading, writing, and manipulating
 * phase space files from various Monte Carlo radiation transport codes. The library
 * provides a unified interface for working with different file formats while
 * preserving format-specific features and metadata.
 * 
 * The namespace contains all classes, functions, and utilities, including:
 * - Phase space file I/O operations
 * - Particle data structures and property management
 * - Universal interface for reading/writing to/from different phase space formats
 * - Format-specific readers and writers
 * 
 * Supported formats include EGS, IAEA, TOPAS, and others.
